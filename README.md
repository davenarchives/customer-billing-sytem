# customer-billing-sytem
This is a simple customer billing system in C language we've made for our Finals PIT

Using final term concepts;
- Functions
- Scope Rules
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Strings
- Structures

What your system will do (transactions):

1. Accounts can be added to the program at any time and it can hold any number of accounts.
2. The programming of simple calculations such as calculation of due amount, balance etc. have been embedded in the code of this project.
3. The system also allows us to search an account by two ways, either by name of the customer or by the number of customer.
4. The due amount to be paid is shown as negative balance.
5. If you have nothing to do with the program, you can directly exit from the main menu.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Account number limits to 10 digits only (ex. 1234567890)
- Customer name only works with one name (ex. Daven)
